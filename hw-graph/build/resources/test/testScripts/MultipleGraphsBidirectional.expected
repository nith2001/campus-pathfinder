# Create graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node m1 to graph2
added node m2 to graph2

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge f1 from m1 to m2 in graph2
added edge f2 from m2 to m1 in graph2

# Print the nodes in each graph and their children
graph1 contains: n1 n2
graph2 contains: m1 m2

the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e2)
the children of m1 in graph2 are: m2(f1)
the children of m2 in graph2 are: m1(f2)
