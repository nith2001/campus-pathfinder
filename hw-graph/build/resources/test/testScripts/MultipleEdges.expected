# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 2 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# Add 4 edges pointing from one node to the other
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e4 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the children of the node in the graph
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3) n2(e4)
