Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

I removed the Graph.Node class because it overcomplicated my implementation and ended up only being an unnecessary wrapper
class. I applied generics to my Graph class and deleted some unnecessary methods like removeNode and removeEdge
since they were not going to be used, which allowed me to reduce my test suite.
