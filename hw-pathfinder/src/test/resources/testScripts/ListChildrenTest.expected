# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 7.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from B to C in simpleGraph

simpleGraph contains: A B C

the children of A in simpleGraph are: B(1.000) B(3.000) B(7.000) B(10.000)

the children of B in simpleGraph are: C(1.000) C(3.000) C(5.000) C(10.000)
