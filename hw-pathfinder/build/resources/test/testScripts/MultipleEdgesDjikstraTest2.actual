# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 7.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000

added edge 1.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
