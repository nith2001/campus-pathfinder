# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in simpleGraph

simpleGraph contains: A B C D

path from A to C:
no path found

path from B to D:
no path found

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000

path from C to D:
C to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
